# A serializer in Django REST Framework does two main jobs:

# Serialization: Converts Django model instances (or other Python objects) into JSON (or XML, etc.) â€” used when sending data to frontend or APIs.

# Deserialization: Takes user input (e.g., JSON from a POST request), validates it, and converts it into Django objects (like saving to the database).
